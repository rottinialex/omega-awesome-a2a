### LLaVA-Plus: Multimodal Assistant with Dynamic Tool Usage

**Category**: Multimodal AI Systems

**Description**: 
LLaVA-Plus introduces a groundbreaking approach to multimodal AI by implementing a skill repository system that enables dynamic tool usage based on visual input. The system maintains a collection of pre-trained vision and vision-language models as tools, activating them contextually to solve complex real-world tasks. Unlike previous approaches, it ensures continuous visual grounding throughout interaction sessions.

**Key Innovation**: 
The system's ability to learn and compose multiple tools on the fly while maintaining visual context throughout the interaction process represents a significant advancement over existing multimodal models. This enables more sophisticated agent-to-agent interactions where visual understanding directly informs tool selection and usage.

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Example implementation structure
class LLaVaPlusSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.skill_repository = {
            'visual_understanding': VisualModel(),
            'generation': GenerativeModel(),
            'knowledge_retrieval': KnowledgeModel()
        }
    
    def process_multimodal_input(self, image, text_query):
        # Determine required tools based on input
        active_tools = self.tool_selector(image, text_query)
        
        # Execute tools in sequence
        results = []
        for tool in active_tools:
            result = self.skill_repository[tool].execute(image, text_query)
            results.append(result)
            
        return self.compose_results(results)
