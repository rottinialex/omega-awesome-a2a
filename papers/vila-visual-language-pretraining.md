Add VILA: Advanced Visual Language Pre-training Analysis and Findings

# VILA: On Pre-training for Visual Language Models

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07533)

## Key Contributions

- Introduces comprehensive analysis of visual language pre-training design choices
- Demonstrates that freezing LLMs during pre-training affects in-context learning capabilities
- Shows benefits of interleaved pre-training data over simple image-text pairs
- Proposes effective text instruction re-blending technique during fine-tuning

## Technical Details

- Architecture: LLM-based with vision augmentation
- Training Strategy: 
  - Controlled step-by-step pre-training process
  - Interleaved data mixing approach
  - Text instruction re-blending during fine-tuning
- Deployment: Optimized for Jetson Orin hardware

## Performance Highlights

- Surpasses LLaVA-1.5 on standard benchmarks
- Enhanced multi-image reasoning capabilities
- Improved in-context learning performance
- Strong zero-shot and few-shot task handling
